<h2>üßê Features</h2>

Here are some of the project's best features:

*   This app includes a sign-up and a login activity with an eye-pleasing user-friendly interface backed up by the Firebase Realtime Database for seamless experience authentication and connectivity.
*   We prioritize user privacy and experience by obtaining the required permissions. We use distinct clickable pins to distinguish between pedestrians' regular vehicles and emergency vehicles. The app automatically focuses on the user when Google Maps services begin. Additionally, we only display the locations of active users within a specified 5-kilometer range to enhance app efficiency and user confidentiality.
*   The app gathers data from vehicle On-board Units via UDP and tracks pedestrians' real-time locations using their mobile GPS. This information is stored and used to create a map of user locations from the Firebase Realtime Database providing features like alerting users to nearby emergency vehicle crossings for a safer navigation experience.
*   The application can automatically identify and alter the map pin image based on the received data type seamlessly transitioning between pedestrian and vehicle states as needed.
